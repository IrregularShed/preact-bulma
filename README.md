# preact-bulma

A go at getting the default [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli)
website working with [bulma](https://bulma.io) via
[react-bulma-components](https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components) and
[preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat). Eventually it'll
be a starter template for preact-cli for future projects (and will get renamed
accordingly).
